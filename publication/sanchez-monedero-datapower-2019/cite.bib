 abstract = {The dual occurrences of constant data collection and use 
of artificial and autonomous systems in the workplace are having a 
profound impact on labour relations and workers’ lives. Whilst much 
focus on the interplay between data processes and work has centered 
on the advent of the gig economy and platform labour, companies 
across the board are intensifying data collection and algorithmic 
decision-making to optimize productivity, implement marketing 
campaigns or forecast events relating to their business. A particular 
area of transformation is in the organization of human resources and 
hiring practices where aspects of sourcing, screening and ranking, 
interviewing and selecting potential candidates is increasingly 
permeated with automated data processes. This paper provides an 
overview of key developments in data-driven hiring in Europe and 
outlines the nature of tasks being automated, the sources of data, 
and the role of predictive analytics in this domain. It will 
specifically point to the growing information asymmetry that 
accompanies the advent of datafication in relation to human 
resources, in which there is a significant increase in the 
information employers gather about potential candidates and a growing 
dependency on extensive profiling practices. The paper will assess 
how these developments transform labour relations through new 
stratifications of power, dehumanization and the simultaneous 
potential for both a reduction and amplification of ‘bias’.},

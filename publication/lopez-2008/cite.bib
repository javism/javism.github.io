 abstract = {We present our planned system for audio and video transmission over DDS. We aim to build a modular, scalable and extensible system which takes advantage of the QoS DDS policies to solve the usual problems experimented in traditional systems (HTTP or RTP based) for multi-conference applications. Our "data-centric" approach uses the publish/subscribe paradigm to decentralize the information. As a result, better scalability, robustness and flexibility are got compared to conventional systems based on the client/server paradigm. Our system uses the DDS middleware for directory service provision and for data transmission and signaling. Our work shows that audio, video, and signaling transmission over DDS is not just possible but appropriate.},

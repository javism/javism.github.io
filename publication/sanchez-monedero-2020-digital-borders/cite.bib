 abstract = {In this book chapter we will introduce several socio-technical systems for the governance of refugees and migrants used by international organizations such as the European Union and its member states. We will try to identify which policies these systems implement, if they can or could guarantee rights, or if on the contrary they are one more piece that contributes to the stigmatization, exclusion and oppression of migrant populations through mechanisms of criminalization, identification and social ordering.},
